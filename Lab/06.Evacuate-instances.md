If a hardware malfunction or other error causes a cloud compute node to fail, you can evacuate instances to make them available again.

To preserve user data on the server disk, configure shared storage on the target host. When you evacuate the instance, Compute detects whether shared storage is available on the target host. Also, you must validate that the current VM host is not operational. Otherwise, the evacuation fails.

There are two different ways to evacuate instances from a failed compute node. The first one using the nova evacuate command can be used to evacuate a single instance from a failed node. In some cases where the node in question hosted many instances it might be easier to use nova host-evacuate to evacuate them all in one shot.
